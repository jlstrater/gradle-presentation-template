== Documentation

=== Type of information being conveyed

* Is this a reference document?
* Does it belongs in the user manual?
* Can it be a separate, independent document like a tutorial?

[.notes]
--
* reference == implementation details
* user manual == explanations of how and why
* tutorials == step by step guides with steps that might need to be tested and quicky become out of date
links to user manual and other reference material but generally can be completed without help of other material
--

=== Who owns the process?

[%step]
* Developers
* Product teams
* Writers

=== Versioning

[.notes]
* Same as product or separate/"current"
* They need to be versioned just like the source code so they refer to historical features/implementations.
* Docs cannot be updated dynamically

Gradle used to have only "current" docs, but soon switched to versions included with the distribution for historical
features/references

=== Out of date docs are worse than no docs at all.
